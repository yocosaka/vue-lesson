# Learning Vue Features
This repository is created for learning fundamental Vue & Vue3 features including Vue Router, Vue CLI, Options API, Composition API, Teleport etc. Along with learning the fetures, I also created several full projects including a reaction timer, project tracker, a real-time chatroom & a music playlist website and update them aside from this repository.

I followed [Build Web Apps with Vue JS 3 & Firebase](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-web-apps-with-vuejs-firebase/) course on Udemy provided by [The Net Ninja (Shaun Pelling)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg).

If you have an interest in getiting in-depth knowledge of Vue3 features and firebase, I highly recommend you take that course.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
